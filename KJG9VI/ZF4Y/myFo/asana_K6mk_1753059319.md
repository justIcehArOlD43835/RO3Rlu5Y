# Raising a new issue & requesting Features

Thanks for being a tester and helping to make Wavebox better by either reporting a bug or raising an issue! Before you create a new issue here are a few things that might be worth checking first...

1. Make sure you're using the latest version. These are available to download on the wavebox.io download page [https://wavebox.io/download](https://wavebox.io/download)

2.  Take a quick look to see if anyone else has already raised an issue on the [issues page](https://github.com/wavebox/waveboxapp/issues). It makes it much easier to track a discussion around a single issue rather than dealing with duplicates

Once you're happy that your issue / feature hasn't already been raised or fixed feel free to raise it!

# Screen capture - suggestions

Below are a few methods/apps that can be used to create screen capture and small videos:

## Windows

There is a built in tool call [Snipping Tool](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/13776/windows-use-snipping-tool-to-capture-screenshots)
which is simple and can be used for screenshots. Otherwise check the below software:

- [ShareX](https://getsharex.com/) - Screenshots + video capture
- [Greenshot](https://getgreenshot.org/) - Screenshots

## MacOS

MacOS does have built in shortcuts to do screenshots also. To find out more see:
[Apple Support](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201361) or check out the below software:

- [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/) - Screenshots
- [Skitch](https://evernote.com/products/skitch) - Screenshots
- [LICEcap](https://www.cockos.com/licecap/) - Video capture

## Linux

Most linux systems you can use standard Print Screen like for example gnome that has
a built in screenshot tool. Below are a few suggestion of software though:

- [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/) - Screenshots
